# Mitigating Bias in Deep Learning Models for Chest X-Ray Analysis
Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) models are transforming healthcare by improving
diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatments, and enhancing patient outcomes.   
However, a critical concern is the potential for these models to exacerbate healthcare disparities, as demonstrated in previous studies. If a model
performs differently across patient subgroups (e.g., by sex, age, race or health insurance status), it may pose safety risks,
as it could unfairly disadvantage certain populations.  
Tackling these challenges is crucial to ensure the fair and safe implementation of ML and DL in healthcare.  
  
Our motivation is to detect, quantify, and mitigate biases in well-known deep-learning models used for disease predictions from x-ray images. 


# How to run the project

You need to have a good GPU to run this project.

## Creating a Conda Environment

To create a Conda environment for this project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda create --name mitigate-bias python=3.8.19
```
To open the environment, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda activate mitigate-bias
```

## Preprocess Data

First download the data from the Chexpert official website and put the files "train.csv", "test.csv" and "df_chexpert_plus_240401.csv" it in data/initial_data folder.  
  
Then run: 

1. Clean tabular data to remove outliers and subjects that will not be used
    ```bash
    /data/data_processing/clean_initial_tabular_data.ipynb
    ```
    This will create a file "processed_data/chexpert_plus_240401_cleaned.csv"


2. Label data and remove useless information
    ```bash
    /data/data_processing/label_and_reduce_data.ipynb
    ```
    This will create a file "final_data/chexpert_plus_240401_cleaned_label.csv"
      
    "sex": {"Male": 0, "Female": 1},  
    "race": {"White": 0, "Asian": 1, "Black": 2},  
    "insurance_type": {"Medicaid": 0, "Medicare": 1, "Private Insurance": 2}  
      
  
3. Create train (60%) / valid (10%) /test split (30%)
    ```bash
    /data/data_processing/create_train_valid_test_split.ipynb
    ```
    This will create files "final_data/chexpert_plus_240401_train.csv", "final_data/chexpert_plus_240401_test.csv", "final_data/chexpert_plus_240401_valid.csv"

4. Data can be explored in
    ```bash
    /data/data_exploration/explore_tabular_data.ipynb
    ```
    
## Image data

1. Download all the images from "huggingface.co/datasets/StanfordAIMI/CheXpert-v1.0-512"
    ```bash
    /data/image_data_processing/download_image_data.ipynb
    ```
    
2. Resize images in (224, 224), add path to resized images to table
    ```bash
    /data/image_data_processing/preprocess_image_data.ipynb
    ```

## Extract embeddings 
We are extracting the embeddings using the densenet model in the torch x-ray vision github. 

1. Densenet embeddings
    ```bash
    /model_dev/pre_trained_densenet_GPU_embeddings.py
    ```
This will create "data_with_embeddings/densenet_test_embeddings.csv", "data_with_embeddings/densenet_train_embeddings.csv", "data_with_embeddings/densenet_valid_embeddings.csv"

## Study embeddings
Study differences in distribution for subgroups
1. Using PCA and tSNE plots 
 ```bash
    /model_embeddings/embeddings_exploration/PCA_exploration_DenseNet_Embeddings.ipynb
 ```

2. Two-sample Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov
   ```bash
    /model_embeddings/embeddings_exploration/statistical_testing.ipynb
   ```

3. Predict subgroups (sex, race, age, health insurance) from embeddings and do some feature importance to know which embedding have information about the subgroups
   ```bash
    /model_embeddings/embeddings_exploration/predict_subgroups_from_embeddings.ipynb
   ```


## Disease predictions from Densenet embeddings, model evaluation, bias detection

1. Prediction using small Multiclass Neural Network=
    ```bash
    /model_eval/densenet_from_embeddings_to_pred_nn_small.ipynb
    ```

2. Prediction using complex Multiclass Neural Network
    ```bash
    /model_eval/densenet_from_embeddings_to_pred_nn_big.ipynb
    ```

3. Prediction using Multiclass XGBoost
    ```bash
    /model_eval/densenet_from_embeddings_to_pred_xgboost.ipynb
    ```
    
4. Prediction using Balanced Random Forest
    ```bash
    /model_eval/densenet_from_embeddings_to_pred_BalancedRandomForest.ipynb
    ```
    
5. Baseline model
    ```bash
    /model_eval/densenet_predicitons_bias_analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Mitigation strategies
1. Rebalancing the subgroups
    ```bash
    /bias_mitigation/bias_mitigation_NN_data_augmentation.ipynb
    /bias_mitigation/bias_mitigation_xgb_data_augmentation.ipynb
    ```

2. Removing embeddings that contain information about the subgroups (sex, race, age, health insurance) 
    ```bash
    /bias_mitigation/bias_mitigation_NN_remove_embeddings.ipynb
    /bias_mitigation/bias_mitigation_xgb_remove_embeddings.ipynb
    ```
3. Subgroup specific models to predict the diseases
    ```bash
    /bias_mitigation/bias_mitigation_xgb_subgroup_specific_models.ipynb
    ```
